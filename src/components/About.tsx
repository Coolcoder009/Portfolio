                <p>
                  I was your classic 12th-grade Bio-Maths kid â€” halfway into becoming a doctor, or so I thought. 
                  The plan? Stethoscope, white coat, and saving lives. Reality?
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, I did what any confused desi student does next: picked engineering.
                  Started off dreaming in Java, chasing SDE roles, leetcode-ing my way through life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But somewhere along the road â€” probably after building one too many CRUD apps â€” I stumbled into the world of AI. 
                  And it hit different. Models that learn, systems that adapt, and logic that thinks? Now thatâ€™s something worth debugging for.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since then, Iâ€™ve been deep in the AI trenches â€” from building chatbots that talk back better than your cousin, to crafting ML pipelines and tweaking neural networks like puzzle pieces.
                  Right now? I'm pushing boundaries, automating the boring, and keeping it ethical (most days ðŸ˜„).
